## 🚩 **The Sustainability Challenge in Metals**

Traditional metals production is stuck in a linear **“take–make–dispose”** loop:

- **Resource Depletion** — Mining drains finite natural reserves.
- **Huge Environmental Impact** — Virgin material processing = high energy use, increased carbon emissions, and pollution.
- **Zero Visibility** — Most engineers, metallurgists, and manufacturers *don’t* have quick, practical tools to quantify a process’s *real* environmental cost. Classic LCA methods are complex, slow, and require expert knowledge.

## 💡 **Our Mission: LCA for Everyone**

We empower industry professionals to make **data-driven, sustainable choices**—quickly, intuitively, and visually.

### **How?**

By **democratizing LCA** through a web platform that delivers instant feedback and smart recommendations, powered by machine learning.

***

## ⚙️ **How It Works (in 4 Steps)**

1. **User-Friendly Web App:** Streamlined UI collects only essential details (Material, Manufacturing Route, Energy Source…).
2. **AI Magic:** Inputs are processed by a pre-trained `RandomForestRegressor` model and `MinMaxScaler`, blending expert datasets with your scenario.
3. **Instant Results:** Instantly see your *Carbon Footprint (kg CO2e/kg)* and *Circularity Score (0–100)*.
4. **Visual Dashboard:** Interactive charts make it effortless to compare scenarios, spot key drivers, and explore “what if” questions.

***

## 🚀 **Key Features**

- **Intuitive Multi-Step Form**: No jargon — just clear steps!
- **Predictive AI**: Get robust, real-world predictions in seconds.
- **Scenario Comparison:** See how recycled vs. virgin inputs change your impact.
- **Rich Visuals**: Dynamic charts capture sustainability outcomes and material flows.
- **Clear Recommendations:** Actionable suggestions empower greener decisions.

***

## 🔍 **Example Use Cases**

- See how using 90% recycled aluminum slashes your carbon impact vs. virgin metal.
- Instantly compare different process routes (e.g., electric arc vs. blast furnace).
- Prioritize sustainability in R\&D, sourcing, client proposals, or compliance.

***

## 👩‍💻 **Technical Overview**

- **Frontend:** Built for clarity, responsiveness, and minimal input hassle.
- **Backend:** Python/Flask API connects input to models, handles preprocessing, and returns results.
- **ML Model:** RandomForestRegressor trained on rich LCA datasets for accuracy + robustness.
- **Deployment:** Hosted and ready for industrial use, experimentation, or education.
