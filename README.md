# \# Life_Cycle_Assesment_Tool

This project is an AI-powered platform designed to help engineers, metallurgists, and manufacturers easily assess and improve the sustainability of their processes. By bridging the gap between traditional industry practices and the principles of a circular economy, our tool provides instant, data-driven insights to promote resource efficiency, reduce waste, and lower carbon footprints.

## The Problem:

### The metals industry has historically operated on a linear "take-make-dispose" model, which leads to significant environmental and economic challenges:

1. Resource Depletion: High reliance on mining depletes finite natural resources.
2. High Environmental Impact: Manufacturing from virgin materials is energy-intensive, generating substantial greenhouse gas emissions and pollution.
3. Lack of Insight: Engineers and manufacturers often lack the practical tools to quickly quantify the environmental impact of their material and process choices. Traditional Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) are complex, time-consuming, and require specialized expertise.
Our project addresses this problem head-on by providing an accessible and actionable solution.

## Our Solution:

Our solution is a simple, intuitive web application that uses a machine learning model to democratize LCA. The platform takes a few key user inputs and instantly provides quantifiable sustainability metrics, making it easy to compare different manufacturing scenarios.
The tool‚Äôs core functionality includes:

1. Predictive AI: A trained RandomForestRegressor model instantly predicts a process‚Äôs Carbon Footprint and Circularity Score based on a minimal number of inputs.
2.Scenario Comparison: Users can compare their proposed process (e.g., using 90% recycled material) against a conventional baseline (e.g., 100% virgin material) to visualize the sustainability benefits.
3.Actionable Insights: The platform provides clear recommendations to help users make more sustainable decisions.
Key Features:
2. Intuitive User Interface: A clean, multi-step form for effortless data input.
3. Real-time Metrics: Instant feedback on two critical metrics: Carbon Footprint (kg CO2e/kg) and Circularity Score (0-100).
4. Visual Data Representation: A dynamic dashboard with charts and diagrams to visualize environmental impacts and material flows.
5. Minimal Inputs: Requires only a few key parameters, such as Material, Manufacturing Route, and Energy Source, to provide a comprehensive analysis.
How It Works:
The project consists of a frontend and a backend, working together to deliver the analysis.
6. Frontend (UI): The user interacts with a web-application built to collect key parameters.
7. Backend (API): The backend server receives the user's input and passes it to the AI model. It handles the data preparation, including one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
8. AI Model: A pre-trained RandomForestRegressor model (SIH_predict.pkl) and a MinMaxScaler (predict_scaler.pkl) process the input data and generate predictions for the Carbon Footprint and Circularity Score.
9. Result Delivery: The backend sends the final, human-readable predictions back to the frontend, where they are displayed on a dynamic dashboard.

## üö© **The Sustainability Challenge in Metals**

Traditional metals production is stuck in a linear **‚Äútake‚Äìmake‚Äìdispose‚Äù** loop:

- **Resource Depletion** ‚Äî Mining drains finite natural reserves.
- **Huge Environmental Impact** ‚Äî Virgin material processing = high energy use, increased carbon emissions, and pollution.
- **Zero Visibility** ‚Äî Most engineers, metallurgists, and manufacturers *don‚Äôt* have quick, practical tools to quantify a process‚Äôs *real* environmental cost. Classic LCA methods are complex, slow, and require expert knowledge.

***

## üí° **Our Mission: LCA for Everyone**
